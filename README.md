# Permuthon
Permuthon is a Python-based esoteric programming language which permutes your variables randomly on every line of code. Additionally, it forces you to use one-char variable names.

The language prevents you from cheating by blocking multiple instructions on one line. An 'IDE' which shows which variable is which is also available.

## Example
For example, the following is an implementation of Fibbonaci in Permuthon:
```py
a = 0
b = 1
while True:
	print(z)
	c = v + u
	d = p
	t = s
	sleep(1)
```

To make any sense of this code, you have to use the IDE:
